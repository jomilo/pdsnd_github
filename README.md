Nanodegree Python Project - Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does
In this project we explore data related to bike share systems for three major
cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project
repository contains code to import the data and answer interesting questions
about it by computing descriptive statistics. The python script
"bikeshare_analytics.py" takes in raw input to create an interactive experience
in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
Following files are used:
- README.md
- .gitignore
- bikeshare_analytics.py (analysis script)
- chicago.csv (input data, ignored for repository scope)
- new_york_city.csv (input data, ignored for repository scope)
- washington.csv (input data, ignored for repository scope)

### Usage of Bikeshare_Analytics
- Open and run bukeshare_analytics.py with python in bash shell
- Enter the name of the city for which you want to analyze data
- Enter time filter settings that should be applied like month, day, both or
  not at all
- Explore the statistics provided for the city and time filter selected
